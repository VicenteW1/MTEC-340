# Call of Duty: Black Ops II 

## What is this game about? Why do I like it?
BO II (an abbreveitaion used by the comunity that comes from COD:BO II, which would be the full name abbrevetaion) is a first person shooter developed by Treyarch and published by activision. The game has 3 different sections, campaign, multiplayer and zombies. Campaing is a gamemode where only one person can play and it follows a stroyline. Multiplayer is a gamemode an online gamemode where you face other people in different gamemodes, like team deaethamtch, free for all, capture the flag, etc. Zombies is also a gamemode that can be played online, depending on the mdoe up to 8 people (2 teams of 4), but the usual and classic mode is up to 4 people. I may like this game because of nostalgia, but it was a great game coming after it's predesor, COD: BO, a good sequel that implemented new things and was great at balancing the online gamemodes. The campaign wqas interesting and fun to play. My favourite gamemode was zombies, the game is known to have the worst maps and the best maps of the game, and I think it's precisely why I like it. The game has good and bad thigns is not perfect but it has it's own essence, it's captivating and fun to play. It created a balance between the 3 gamemodes, since in other editions the campaginw as lacking, maybe it didn't have campagin at all, or the balancing team for the online gamemodes were really poor. I really like this game because of the nostalgia and the good times, but also becasue of what at the time and even now, a great quality game.
